# Pusher Channels chunked events example

Pusher Channels limits the event size to 10kb.
One approach to work around this limit is to "chunk" your events.
This repository shows a protocol for chunking,
and example implementations of this.

This repository has one folder for each Pusher Channels library.
Please contribute more examples!
